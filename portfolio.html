                        Software Development Engineer Intern | Amazon Web Services IAM | June 2024-Sept 2024
                        <ul>
                            <li>Engineered  a full-stack AWS live-site operations tool, significantly boosting engineer productivity by automating manual processes for correlating fleetwide deployments in order to isolate root cause.</li>
                            <li>Developed an AWS Lambda microservice in Java, integrating with six internal AWS APIs to automate the correlation of regional deployments with incident tickets, reducing a tedious, multi-step manual process from 10 steps to 1.</li>
                            <li>Created a React component in TypeScript, deployed on a live-site tools dashboard, improving accessibility and speed for on call engineers.</li>
                            <li>Streamlined incident management via automated ticket comments, reducing engineer workload by posting correlated regional deployments as ticket comments to further accelerate root cause identification.</li>
                            <li>Collaborated with cross-functional teams and engineers to define technical requirements, onboard to necessary services, implement secure authentication, and ensure seamless deployment in compliance with AWS standards.</li>
